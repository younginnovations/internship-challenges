## What's wrong with the form?

### What you need to do

* If you haven’t already, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-form-wrong” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo


#### Problem

* Copy the following [folder](code) into your php-enabled web server. 
* Access this [form](code/form.php) from the browser

* Describe, in list format, what is wrong with the given form. List as many issues as possible in a separate file "issues.txt". 
* Fix the [form code](code/form.php) to address the issues you have identified.
* Push both the code and "issues.txt" to the repo.

### Bonus points

* If you can write a UI testing code to automate the form testing (using Selenium).
