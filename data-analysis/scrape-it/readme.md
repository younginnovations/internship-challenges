## Scrape it

### What you need to do

* If you haven’t already, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.simplilearn.com/learn-git-basics-skillup).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-scrape-it” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

Write code which will scrape all the data to CSV from the following [html page](https://cdn.rawgit.com/younginnovations/internship-challenges/master/data-analysis/scrape-it/exampledata.html) in any one of the following programming languages (node, python, php, golang). If you don’t know what scraping is, now is the time to learn! 

The filename should be run.php, run.py, run.js or run.go according to the language you complete the challenge in. 

Your code should run from the cli as shown below. If you don’t know how to use cli in one of the given languages, it's time to learn this as well. 

In php, 
`php run.php`

In python, 
`python run.py`

In node,
`node run.js`

In go,
`go run run.go`

Your run script should create a folder called "out" and write a file "data.csv" inside that folder.

Push your codes and "data.csv" file to the repo, maintaining the folder structure.

### Bonus points

* If you write unit tests for your code
* If you write a readme file with the necessary instructions to run the code

**Note**: If you are creating a separate class file and accessing that class file from your run script, your class filename should be "scraper.php", "scraper.py" and so on for other languages.
