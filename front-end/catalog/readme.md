* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-frontend-2025” in [github](https://github.com/new)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite `yi-internship` to that particular private repo
* Submit your application
