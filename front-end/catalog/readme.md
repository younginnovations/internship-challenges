## Frontend the design

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already done so, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-frontend-challenge” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

1.  Open the Frontend Challenge UI using this [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/XRnfVIsxJLoyJIzuUqQto0/Internship-Test---Frontend?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design).
2. Once open, you'll  be able to see following screen: 
 - Homepage
3. Your assignment is to turn the "Homepage" screen into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS and JS. You also need to implement the dropdown menu and the popup searchbox and carousel.
4. Additionally, integrate the provided API endpoint to display news articles in the designated news section. Here's the endpoint - (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/younginnovations/internship-challenges/master/front-end/news_list.json)
5. Upload the html/css/js file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment and using them as judging criteria:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Figma
- The HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tags
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness
- CSS preprocessors 
- CSS/ JS animations
