## Frontend the design

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already done so, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-frontend-challenge” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

1. Open the Frontend Challenge UI using this [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/XRnfVIsxJLoyJIzuUqQto0/Internship-Test---Frontend?type=design&mode=design).
2. Once open, you'll  be able to see designs in the "Final" page of the Figma document
3. Your assignment is to turn the given design into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS (if possible JS). 
4. Upload the html/css/js file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment and using them as judging criteria:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Figma
- The HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tags
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness
- CSS preprocessors (plus point)
- CSS/ JS animations (plus point)
