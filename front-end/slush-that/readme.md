## Slush that design

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already done so, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Once complete, create a private repo called “yipl-slush-that” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

1. Send us an email at internship@yipl.com.np with the subject "Zeplin request for Internship Challenge" and wait for at least a day to hear from us.
2. You'll receive an invite from a design tool called 'Zeplin'. To learn more about Zeplin, click here: https://zeplin.io/
3. Using Zeplin, you'll be able to access and open a project called "Internship Challenge"
4. Once open, you'll  be able to see following screen: 
 - Landing Page
5. Your assignment is to turn the "Landing Page" screen into an interactive web page using HTML/ CSS (if possible JS). 
5. Upload the html/css/js file into your repo

We'll be looking into following aspects of your assignment and using them as judging criteria:
- How well the webpage you've made matches with the design file in Zeplin
- The HTML/ CSS structure 
- Use of proper tags
- Naming convention of class names
- Use of shorthand properties
- Folder structure
- Responsiveness
- CSS preprocessors (plus point)
- CSS/ JS animations (plus point)
